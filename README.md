# Customer segmentation and sales analysis
This project aims to analyze customer purchasing behaviors and segment them into distinct groups for targeted marketing and sales optimization. By utilizing data analytics and machine learning techniques, we identify key customer segments based on factors like total_price, quantity, unit_price, and reward_points. The project leverages Hierarchical Clustering for customer segmentation and performs various exploratory data analysis (EDA) tasks to understand patterns and relationships in the dataset.


Key Steps:
 
 Data Preprocessing:
   Handle missing values and convert data types.
   Perform feature engineering.
 
 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   Descriptive statistics and visualizations (e.g., sales by city, product, and correlation matrix).
 
 Outlier Detection:
   Identified and corrected outliers in numerical columns like total_price, quantity, and unit_price.
 
 Customer Segmentation:
   Applied Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering to segment customers into 4 distinct clusters.
 
 Clustering Results:
  Results showed varying purchasing behaviors across clusters (e.g., high spenders vs. low spenders).
